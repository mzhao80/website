I currently research agentic coding capabilities at Google DeepMind, which I came over to after working on the model training team at the AI code editor startup Windsurf.

I graduated *summa cum laude* and Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard College with an A.B. in Computer Science and Government, and also concurrently completed my A.M. in Statistics. On campus, I led [Harvard Computer Society](https://www.hcs.harvard.edu), organized study groups with visiting fellows from Congress and the Cabinet through the [Institute of Politics](https://www.iop.harvard.edu), and sang all four years with the [Harvard Glee Club](https://www.harvardgleeclub.org).

In college, I conducted research in computational social science, with an emphasis on statistical methods for better understanding Congress and elections. My senior thesis "Words Speak as Loudly as Actions: Deep Learning Methods for Stance-Based Ideal Points from Congressional Speeches," advised by [Prof. Ariel Proccacia](https://procaccia.info/) and [António Câmara](https://ascamara.github.io/) won the Thomas Temple Hoopes Prize for outstanding thesis and the Gerda Richards Crosby Prize for the highest-ranked student in Government (pre-print forthcoming). My work with [Prof. Kosuke Imai](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/) on the [ALARM Project](https://alarm-redist.org/) to better understand gerrymandering has also led to [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11336) that quantitatively evaluates redistricting reforms through a game-theoretic and causal inference framework, as well as an [R package](https://alarm-redist.org/alarmdata/) for working with redistricting data.

I'm always happy to meet new people, gain new experiences, and chat about big ideas and interesting tidbits in the world – feel free to send me an email at michaelzhao[at]alumni[dot]harvard[dot]edu!
